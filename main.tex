% This is the command for doublespacing when you use the setspace
% package
% Please do NOT use \baselinestretch, this will mess up everything,
% cause earthquakes, tornados and lots of questions for me...
% If you need a singlespaced paragraph (BAD STYLE!!!), use
% \singlespacing or \onehalfspacing and enclose it together with the
% paragraph in braces {\singlespacing This is my text... blah blah blah}
%
\doublespacing

% Now you can start to be creative.
% First, you need an abstract.
% Fortunately, LaTeX has thought of that, so it's very easy:
\input{Chapters/Abstract}

% From here on, we need Roman page numbers according to the library
% regulations. So let's assign those.

\pagenumbering{roman} % or {Roman} if you like them capitalized


\input{Chapters/Acknowledgements}
\input{Chapters/Dedication}
% The next thing is the Preface (``Acknowledgements'').
% No standard environment for that, so we'll format it by hand.
%


% P.S. You don't have to add me to the acknowledgements for providing 
% this file :)

\clearpage


% Now comes the Table of Contents, really easy in LaTeX. you never
% have to worried about it. (Think of all the hours you would
% have wasted in Word getting this thing updated without crashing
% the system) :).

\tableofcontents

% THAT'S IT. REALLY. Everything else is automatic. No formatting, no headline.
% All predefined.

% Now - just as easy - the List of Figures.
% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{figure}\end{figure}
% statements.
\listoffigures

% There is also a list of tables, if you have any.
% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{table}\end{table}
% statements.
\listoftables


% \newcommand{\listequationsname}{List of Equations}
% \newlistof{myequations}{equ}{\listequationsname}
% \newcommand{\myequations}[1]{%
% \addcontentsline{equ}{myequations}{\protect\numberline{\theequation}#1}\par}

% \listofmyequations

% And we need a clear separation between preface and text, otherwise
% the numbering gets confused.

\clearpage

% And now - tataa - the text.
% This is the place to become really creative.

% From here on, we need arabic numbering again and we need to start
% from 1.
