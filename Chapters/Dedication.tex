This is dedication to my Great Uncle Lawrence "Larry" Solomon (June 28, 1949 to March 3, 2007) who I named the exoskeleton after "Legged Articulated Robotic Rehab Exoskeleton(LARRE). Larry suffered a C6 SCI in 1968 at 19 yrs old while practicing a gymnastics long vault at Springfield College. He lived a full and inspiring life. Within months of his accident, Larry was asked to help inspire the other young people with SCI injuries with his positive attitude. He never let his SCI injury stop him from doing anything. He went on to get a Doctorate in Education Administration before the days of computers and all the technology available today to people with SCIs and served on the Presidential Council  of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Larry was a great husband, father, brother, and uncle. He made everyone around him feel like they were the most important person in the room. Although, I never had a chance to know him very well, I have been told that he was one of the most inspirational people you could ever know.
