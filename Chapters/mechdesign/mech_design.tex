\section{Contributions}

The developed exoskeleton allows for a modular and comprehensive method to test and develop different joint mechanisms. The modular connection interfaces allowed for the development of several different mechanisms. The mechanical design and SolidWorks parts were released open-source for the community to use. By providing the basic mechanical structure, researchers can put more effort into constructing new sensors and mechanical actuators instead of the entire system. The platform also allows for adjustment to the user. The legs can be extended to fit the person's legs, and the hip-width can be expanded to ensure a good fit. This feature is critical for testing the exoskeleton on different people. The presented joint designs underwent testing and analysis to show the functionality. The two different knee designs each provide a novel and unique design approach. The wrap spring clutch mechanism is a quasi-passive system that will provide support to the user and prevent buckling. The Bio-knee fit can be easily manufactured and designed to fit the anthropomorphic parameters of the person.
