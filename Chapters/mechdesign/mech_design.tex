\section{Contributions}

The developed exoskeleton allows for a modular and comprehensive method to test and develop different joints mechanisms. The modular connection interfaces allowed for the development of several different mechanisms. The mechanical design and SolidWorks parts were released open source for the community to use. By providing the basic mechanical structure, researchers can put more effort into constructing new sensors and mechanical actuators instead of the entire system. The platform also allows for adjustment to the user. The legs can be extended to fit the person's legs, and the hip-width can be expanded to ensure a good fit. This feature is critical for testing the exoskeleton on different people.
