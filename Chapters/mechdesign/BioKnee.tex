\section{Bio-Mechanical knee}

\subsection{Overview}
The work done in this section was in collaboration with Alex Tacescu \cite{tacescu2021development} and presented at International Mechanical Engineering Congress 2021 [WAITING FOR CITATION]. I led and managed the focus of the project and came up with the idea. I was also involved with running the mocap experiments and the mechanical design. Another knee design was examined that focused on matching the knee motion profile to a human knee. Exoskeletons discussed in \autoref{sec:ExoBack} commonly use pin-type joints in their knee joints; this is in contrast to how the actual kinematics work in a human knew, which has a variable center of rotation or a floating axis \cite{morrison1970mechanics} \cite{koo2008knee} \cite{grood1983joint}.  This is illustrated by examining MRI scans of knee which show that the femur and tibia have oblong heads\cite{MRIKneeScan}. This geometry translates the tibia as the knee rotates.

Several recent designs have focused more on accounting for knee motion. Choi \textit{et. al} used multiple rolling cams to adapt to the changing center of rotation \cite{choi2017development}. This design fits a person's knee motion; it did not use modeling of the knee's tibiofemoral motion to design the cams. Additionally, the design is complicated and not easily reproducible. In another design Choi \textit{et. al} used multiple rollers and pulleys powered by electric linear actuators. However, rotary electric motors with rotary gearboxes can often achieve higher performance than electric linear actuators powered by rotary DC motors. Another knee design was presented in \cite{wang2018comfort}; this design prioritized the comfort of the user and the alignment of the knee joint. This design also uses pulleys and cables to model the knee motion. \cite{AdaptiveKneeJoint} presents a cam knee design that uses a model of the knee motion. This design is a significant improvement over previous designs that merely compensate for the motion. However, as the other designs discussed, they use linear actuators.  These designs do well at either mimicking or compensating for the knee motion; however, they are mechanically cumbersome to manufacture; they did not show mimicking of the center of rotation's theoretical movement and/or use a linear actuator to replicate rotary motion. In addition, the design does not allow for the knee to be customized and therefore cannot meet the specific motion of the patient. Thus, we propose a knee design that is readily configured to match a particular patient's knee joint motion, is designed for easy manufacturing, and allows the use of readily available rotary actuators and brake mechanisms.

The variable center of rotation was found using previous work by Iwaki \textit{et. al} that used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to determine and predict the knee's trajectory \cite{MRIKneeShape_Loaded, MRIKneeShape_Unloaded}. These studies used cadavers and actual patients to measure the motion of the knee in both loaded and unloaded scenarios. This MRI data was used in \cite{KinDynKneeJoint} to build a mathematical model of knee motion that considers both the flexion and extension degrees of freedom. They used ellipse to model the contact between the femur and tibia bones. Their work leads to the formulation of \autoref{eq:KneeExtensionFlexionNumeric}. This equation relates the rotation (in radians) of the knee to the translation of the tibia. In these equation $a$ is a scaling factor and $d$ is an initial offset \cite{wang2013adaptive}. Both of these values are patient specific and can be found using an MRI or motion capture study. This motion and its derivative are shown in \autoref{fig:FlexExtRelationship}. This study was limited since it was based on the anthropomorphic parameters of a single person. These coefficients will vary slightly from person to person and can be found using MRIs or potential motion capture. 

The difficulty in using motion capture is the error caused by manual palpation of bony land marks and skin movement. The manual palpation of body land markers if going to vary subject to subject and is difficult to  be consistent. Several studies of examined the effects using skin markers to locate the floating knee axis which can be on the order of several millimeters Eugene \textit{et. al} discussed several methods that which decrees the skin movement error. \cite{alexander2001correcting} \cite{cappozzo1996position}. While these methods do decrees the skin error, they are still not perfect especial when examining the knee joint.  Anderson \textit{et. al} found even an addition of joint constraints did not improve the reliable of skin mounted markers. Manipulation can also effect the accuracy of MRI knee studies, incorrectly identifying the correct body land marks can effect kinematics studies and the location of the knee axis \cite{lerner2003use} and can result in 1.2mm or error.

\subsection{Mechanical Development}

A cam-type mechanism with a brushless DC motor was designed to follow the desired path. The guide was generated using \autoref{eq:KneeExtensionFlexionNumeric}.

\autoref{fig:a_varying} shows the effect of varying the scaling parameters. This values will scale the trajectory. This will effect the relationship of the rotation and translation of the tibia. \autoref{fig:KneePlateDesign} shows the knee cam for several scaling values as illustrated it the cam profile is altered. This guide enforces variable center of rotation and motion of the tibia. \autoref{fig:ExplodedViewLabeled} shows an exploded view of the knee mechanism.

The motor and gearbox need to provide sufficient torque and power to drive the knee of a $100kg$ patient through gait motion. This mass is larger than the average mass of the North American paraplegic, which is $68.8kg$, so assuming a larger mass allows for the motor to have a safety factor. Additionally, it is assumed that the dynamic loads are assumed to be negligible during the slow-motion collision with the ground. It equates to approximately $65W$ of power and $25Nm$ of torque at \(15^\circ/sec\). The knee is powered by a $90W$ brushless Maxon motor used with a nominal torque of $0.56Nm$ at roughly $2500rpm$.  The motor is combined with a Harmonic gearbox with a $100:1$ reduction. \autoref{table:MotorGearboxSpecs} shows the gearbox and motor specifications and the joint's mechanical properties. The calculations assumed an efficiency of \(90\%\) as per the manufacturer documentation. The designed knee joint can mechanically output $81W$ and $50.4Nm$ at $15^\circ/sec$.

\subsection{Design Analysis}

The design was validated using a motion capture system and SolidWorks motion analysis \footnote{https://www.solidworks.com/category/simulation-solutions}. The markers on the knee were aligned on the shank and thigh segments of the knee and rotated through the desired motion as shown in \autoref{fig:KneeJointTestSetup}; this allowed us to compare the theoretical trajectory to the actual trajectory, and for the measurement and comparison of manufacturing tolerance. \autoref{fig:KneeJointTestResults} shows the results of the study. There are some slight deviations of the actual motion compared to the desired motion; this deviation is caused by hysteresis in the system. However, these movements are very slight on a scale of less than $1mm$, which is assumed to be negligible.

\subsection{MRI Testing}

The work in this section is still underwork and being done with Tess Meier. 


To measure the alignment of the bio joint with the underling bone structure an MRI analysis was conducted. This study was approved by  the Worcester Polytechnic Institute IRB. In this study 6 subjects wear MRI wearing both a simple pin joint and the bio joint described above. Both joints were alerted to be MRI compatible which ment remove any metal in the joints.  The pin joint knee is shown in \autoref{fig:MRIPINJoint} and the MRI compatible bio-joint is shown in \autoref{fig:MRIBIOJoint}. This consisted of using only plastic nuts and bolts and the main cam body was water cut from polycarbonate, the strap carriages were made from 3D printed PLA. A small piece of medical grade foam was placed on the inside each of the strap carriages for patient comfort.

\end{figure}



In the study the subjects were scanned wearing both the pin and bio joint at three different angle, the knee straight out ($0^{\circ}$), a high flex angle ($\sim34^{\circ}$),  and a mid flex angle  ($\sim20^{\circ}$). \autoref{fig:MRIKneeAngles} shows a overlay of a several MRI scans at the different angles. This figure also illustrates the rolling-sliding motion of the femur head on the tibia head. A limitation of the study was the angles could be measured, the diameter size of the bore prevented large angles to be measured. Foam blocks were placed under the subjects knee and a foot brace were used to hold the position of the knee during the scan.

\section{Conclusion}
The presented prototype of the knee joint can move through the desired joint range and replicate the tibiofemoral path of a biological knee. \autoref{fig:LARRBio-Knee} shows the presented knee in the rendering of LARRE. The motor produces the required torque, and the potentiometer and encoder in the motor allow for feedback control. The use of FEA showed that the knee could withstand the anticipated forces without structurally failing. These tests are necessary for ensuring that the knee can withstand force. The knee is a key joint for maintaining upright posture and preventing falling. If the knee joint fails during operation the patient could fall and be injured. 

A key part of the design was ensuring that the system could be easily manufactured and customized. All of the parts are can be manufactured with minimal manufacturing experience. All of the custom components are 3D printable on inexpensive consumer-grade 3D printers with consumer-grade PLA filament. The other components are off-the-shelf components. The presented design is ideal for customization and manufacturing. The presented knee was designed to follow a previously established trajectory. Additional testing needs to be conducted to identify the patient-specific parameters so that the polynomial can be fitted to the individual. Using MRI images of the femur and tibia heads or potential using motion capture to measure the translation and rotation of the tibia relative to the femur, this work is currently ongoing.
