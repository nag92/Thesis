\chapter{Collection and Analysis of Human Gait Data}
\label{chap:gaitdata}
\section{Introduction}

Marker-based motion capture systems(mocap) are popular methods of collecting biomechanical data. The body's movement can be tracked by placing markers on various locations on a person's body. These systems produce significant data, including marker positions, joint angles, and rigid body orientation. Additional sensors, such as Electromyography sensors (EMGs), force plates, and inertial measurement units (IMUs), can be added to measure muscle activity and joint torques. Marker-based trackers work by using several 2D cameras to track the 3D position of retro-reflective markers.  

Biomechanists and engineers use this data for kinematics, dynamics, and kinetics of human motion analysis, and to learn motion primitives of human motion \cite{10.7717/peerj.918}. It has been used for the assessment of orthosis \cite{kobetic2009development},  to analyze gait motion for people with lower-limb impairments \cite{lauer2005application} \cite{hicks2011lower}  \cite{cutler2015using} , and to learn and replicate human motion \cite{ott2008motion} \cite{chalodhorn2007learning}. 

The human leg is built with three joints; a hip, a knee and an ankle as shown in \autoref{fig:leg_with_label}. The hip can be modeled as a ball and socket joint allowing for abduction/adduction, and transverse external/internal rotation \cite{faptakinesiology}. The knee is not a simple hinge joint, and the tibia extends during flexion/extension rotation. It allows slight abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation. The knee is also responsible for taking loads during a gait cycle \cite{kuo2007six}. The ankle joint is a synovial joint that helps absorb loads during a gait cycle. These joints are essential for understanding the gait cycle.

\section{Motion Capture Trials}

One of the Motion Capture Trial's goals is to collect enough data to mimic the motion of a healthy gait.  Despite how widely studied and researched the gait cycle and the numerous gait trials conducted, there is very little open-source raw data available, the most popular is the Winter $\it{et. al}$ database \cite{winter1991biomechanics}, yet this library only contains a few subjects. There are other gait data libraries available, but small and have additional restrictions for use. There is a need for additional data to be released for public use. The more data available, the better it helps to train robotics systems and develop exoskeletons and orthosis \cite{moore2015elaborate}. Additional gait and human motion data were collected and released open-source in Github \footnote{https://github.com/WPI-AIM/AIM\_GaitData} to solve this problem. The gait database comprises measurements of how gait varies from person to person when walking across the floor several times and climbing stairs of varying heights. 


\subsection{System setup}
\label{sec:setup}
The Vicon\footnote{Vicon Motion Systems Ltd, Oxford, UK}  Vantage V5 running at $100Hz$ was used to record the locomotion of a person. The system consisted of 10 cameras to track the position of the reflective markers. The makers were placed according to the plug-in gait lower limb template. Two AMTI \footnote{https://www.amti.biz/index.aspx} force plates were placed in the ground to record the joint dynamics. The force plates were synced to the Vicon through the Lock+ box \footnote{https://www.vicon.com/hardware/devices/lock/} running at $1000Hz$. \autoref{fig:markers} shows the placement of the markers on the legs of the subject.

Eleven able-bodied subjects participated in the study (5F, 6M). The Institutional Review Board of Worcester Polytechnic Institute approved the study, and each subject gave written consent. The data was anonymous, so the subjects could not be identified. \autoref{tab:subjects} holds the metadata of the subjects. All the data was saved in an ASCII format file. The custom open-source software package parses the data (\autoref{chap:software}).

 In the first task, the subjects walked approximately 3$m$ at their own pace and stride length \cite{peters2014concurrent}. The subjects were allowed to choose their leading leg. The subject walked across the floor three times to ensure that good data was collected. 

 In the second task, the subjects walked forward approximately 2$m$ and climbed three steps at their own pace. Markers were placed on each step of the staircase and on the floor to record their positions. The subjects approached the staircase, paused, and climbed the stairs with their leading leg. Each subject was allowed to climb at their own pace. Each subject repeated the action three times for each of the four different stairs of different heights, stair heights given in \autoref{tab:stairs}. The repetition of each subject ensured that a good sample trial with no marker occlusion was collected.

\section{Analysis of Human Gait}

The goal of collecting the human motion data was to build a model for replicating the gait cycle to allow the exoskeleton to follow a natural joint motion. Using multiple demonstrations to train a stable estimation of a multi-dimensional dynamic system of nonlinear motion can be learned \cite{li2018development}. The mocap provides an abundance of data to study the motion of human movement. The individual marker location is used to learn the motion of a body segment. Since it is desired to generate a walking motion, the joint angles throughout the gait cycle create the training demonstrations.  A single gait cycle was extracted from each of the gait cycles,  \autoref{fig:TrainingDemosGait} shows the extracted gait cycles. Each of the lines represents a different subject. As expected, the gait cycles follow a similar trajectory with slight variation in starting and endpoints. The slight different in the beginning of some of the demonstrations is due to the extraction method. This does not effect how the demonstrations are used to learn the trajectory. The gait cycles for each individual were consistent.

    \label{fig:TrainingJointPosition}
\end{figure}

TPGMM (\autoref{eq:MstepTPGMM}, \autoref{eq:EstepTPGMM}) was used to learn the motion of the trajectory. This unsupervised learning method allows for the features of the motion to be extracted for encoding. This method has not been used for learning and implementing gait motions as discussed in \autoref{sec:applfd}.  The advantages of this method are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Allows the use of natural gait motions instead of hand-coded motion.
    \item Temporal scaling of the trajectory allowing for gaits to be slowed down or speed up.
    \item Spatial scaling of the motion allowing for the start and goal positions.
    \item Principled approach for the distribution of the Gaussians.
    \item Provides mixture model parameters for measuring the variance along with the demonstrations.
\end{itemize}


The BIC score was calculated for bin size 10-30 using  \autoref{eq:BIC}; due to the randomization initialization, the score and optimal bin size vary slightly. \autoref{fig:BIC} shows the BIC score for the bins sizes. On average, the optimal number of bins converged to learn the walking model is 15 bins.    

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/gait_data/BIC_Walk.png}
    \caption[BIC Score for Walking]{The BIC Score that Determines the Number of Bins}
    \label{fig:BIC}
\end{figure}

The TPGMM process places the Gaussians that drive the system along the trajectory; this is shown in \autoref{fig:force}, the blue lines are the underline demonstrations transformed into a force.  The demonstrations were aligned using DTW. The red dots and green ovals are the means and covariances, and each oval is one of the bins (refer to \autoref{fig:cov_mat} for the calculations of the Gaussians).  GMR regresses over the means and covariances produced by the TPGMM process, accomplished through a superposition process of the overlapping Gaussians. The Gaussians with a smaller major and minor axis indicate a tight correlation, and the larger major and minor axis indicate less correlation of the points on the trajectory.  The Gaussians on the knee and ankle graphs have a slight variance along the demonstrations leading to small Gaussians. In contrast, the hip demonstrations have a more considerable variance leading to larger Gaussians. \autoref{fig:learnedModel} show the comparison of the learned model compared to the training demonstrations. The thin lines are the training demonstrations; the thick line is the trained model. The trajectories were extracted from the learned model above and used DMPs to reproduce each of the joints' trajectories.

In addition to learning the joint angles, the forward kinematics of the leg were recorded by using the marker on the toe as a training source. This data was collected from multiple demonstration of normally ablied walking in the exoskeleton. \autoref{fig:learnedToe} shows the forcing function and replicated gait motion using a marker placed on the toe of the subjects—the $Z$ and $X$ axis in the plane of motion as referenced in \autoref{fig:TrainingJointPosition}. The $Y$ out of plane was not learned since the system is contrasted to the sagittal plane. In all four graphs, the blue lines are the training demonstrations for the model. The green ovals in the upper two graphs are the Gaussians, with the red dot being the mean. In the lower two graphs, the black lines are replicated, motion model. Using BIC, it was determined that 7 was the optimal number of bins to use. As shown in \autoref{fig:FK_BIC}, 3-15 bins were tested 10 times to ensure proper convergence and ensured that a local minimization was found. In all but two iterations, the BIC score remained identical. In the two remaining cases, the BIC score differed in the final bin size and did not affect the minimum BIC score.


Similarly \autoref{fig:learnedToeTransformed} shows the toe marker position transformed into the body frame located on the back of the subject. This transformation allows for more generalized trajectory planing since it is located in the frame of the person. However, on aspected of this transformation is that is natural encodes the subjects height into the model. If applied the offset will have to be accounted during replication.

Once the model is encoded using the tools discussed in \autoref{chap:software} can reproduce the joint trajectories. The processes to learn and reproduce the trajectories are separate systems allowing the encoding to be conducted offline and reproduced online. These models are used to generate the gait cycle for the exoskeleton in simulation. 


\section{Contributions}

All of the data collected was released open-source for community use and analysis. While there are other databases of gait motion out there, this data set provides additional information such as marker positions and joint torques. More markers and rigid bodies were used during the mocap trials than in past studies. The rigid bodies allow for analysis of leg the segment's relative motion. The raw marker position is valuable and can be used to observe the leg joints' forward kinematics. 

Additionally, an extensive database of stair climbing motions was released. This open-source database contains all the kinematics information of how people of different ages, gender, heights climb stairs. This database helps study how people adjust to climbing stairs and help program robots to reproduce this motion. The trajectories can be encoded and reproduced on a human-robotic system. 

The collected information was used to learn motion models that replicated gait trajectories in joint and task spaces. Both of which were optimized using BIC. Using the BIC score, the optimal number of bins was found to train the model. These generalized trajectories allow for various types of controls to be implemented. The generalized model will allow researchers to access lower leg models to be used on their own exoskeletons or legged robotic systems.
