I would like to acknowledgement my mom and dad who have all ways supported and believed in me. They never let me quit or let people tell me what I could do or could not do. My brothers Ben and Max who were very understanding of their older brother disappearing for six year and still always including me. My grandparents Mom-Mom and Poppy who always made sure I was fed when I came home. Thank you for all the support over this years, I could not of done it without you!

I would also like to thank everyone who helped and guided me through my research. I would like to thank Professor Fischer who was very patient with me over years and answered all my questions. You pushed me to explore new areas that I would otherwise would not. The resource you provided me will help me for years to come. I would also like to thank all the students that worked with me over the years. The first two students Vishnu Subramani and Nathan Michael who were there in the early years and worked so hard to help build the early stages of the exoskeleton. Also Charles Bales who worked countless hours with me to run mocap trials which helped me greatly. Ben Secino and Alex Tacescu who helped design new and exciting features for the exoskeleton. Tess Meier who helped with the MRI trials and gave me ride in terrible Massachusetts weather. All of you helped me get to where I am today, thankyou.
