\section{Overview}

The majority of this work was focused on the open-source development of new methods and tools. This method of development served two purposes; the first was to start the lower limb exoskeleton development in the AIM lab, and second to provide tools for other researchers to build and develop their own exoskeleton without having to rebuild the fundamental building blocks and tools required to conduct motion capture research, use the AMBF simulation package, and build an exoskeleton. 

\section{Mechanical Development}

The development of lower limb exoskeletons should be designed to meet the person's needs. It should mimic natural gait motion and provide the necessary torques to the joints. Additionally, the exoskeletons must not have sharp edges or pinch points that could harm the person; this is especially important because people with SCI have limited sensory ability and would not be able to if they are injured. 

One of the primary goals of the development of LARRE was to assemble and provide models for other researchers to use, develop, and improve their own lower limb exoskeletons. The current lower limb exoskeletons on the market are expensive and cannot be easily accessed by researchers. Releasing the open-source components allows others to develop on top of the base platform, which is crucial for new software and hardware research so the development can be pushed further. The modular nature of LARRE enables other systems to build upon the base model of LARRE. 

The dissertation developed and tested a couple of knee mechanisms; the wrap-spring clutch knee and the bio-knee. Each has its unique pros and cons. The wrap-spring clutch knee is designed for passive motion and support. It does not require a motor for actuation since it relies on the swing motion of the leg. Without the need for a motor, the knee has less mass, which lowers the hip motor's overall inertia and allows for a power-efficient system. It was shown that this design could withstand the anticipated force for a prolonged period of time.   

The bio-knee is focused on attempting to replicate the underlying biomechanics of a knee. It attempts to lower the stress on the person by not simplifying the knee joint to a simple pin joint. Integrating a Maxon motor and harmonic gearbox into the knee allows the knee to be powered and used for actuation and trajectory control; this has the advantage of being used for precise control of the knee. Additionally, the knee is simple to build and customize to the individual. Unlike other systems that use complicated cams or pulls, this design has a single part that can be customized, ideal for personalized medicine since it can be quickly and easily manufactured. The disadvantage is that it adds complexity and additional mass and inertia into the system. The additional mass and inertia make it more difficult to be carried by the hip motors and gearboxes.



\section{Open Source Software and Human Motion Data}

A couple of software packages were developed to enable the research presented in this dissertation. The open-source toolkits enable other researchers to access and study their data using a well-built API. The Vicon toolkit fills in a need gap in the tools provided in marker analysis. The Vicon toolkit provides the marker's lower-level access and linear algebra tools to transform and manipulate the markers. While other software packages provided tools to examine human motion, they do not necessarily allow direct access to the markers or rigid bodies. In contrast, the Vicon toolkit does offer these tools, which is important since the marker contains vital information. This information can be used for learning motion and comparing the relative position of markers over the trial. 

This dissertation released additional gait and stair climbing data for others to use. This gait data contains rich marker information to study and examine how people move. By releasing the data to the community, others can study gait motion without conducting their own human motion trials; this can be expensive and time-consuming. 

The open-source software and gait data provide a full package of rich open-source data and powerful tools to manipulate and analyze the data. The collected gait data was used to learn generalized gait cycles and climb stairs. The gait cycles from the different trials can be easily compared and used to learn a generalized trajectory using the open-source toolkit. 


\section{Learning Motion}


Using multiple human demonstrations allows for generalized trajectories to be learned. These generalized trajectories can be replicated and reproduced. The leg length can be encoded into the model allowing for abstraction by using the multiple demonstrations. This was shown by using the stair trajectories to generate joint trajectories for different stair heights and is important since it shows that a limited data set can be used to generate a wide variety of joint trajectories. 

Multiple trajectories can be used for training and reproduction using the GMM process with DMPs. The use of smoothing on the training demonstrations decreases the metric of imitation for the training model. Ensuring that the demonstrations are continuously differentiable, the forcing function accurately produces the desired motion. 

\section{AMBF and Dynamic Server}


The AMBF simulation is still new and experimental. It is not yet ready for the control of a bipedal walking pattern. There are still frictional patterns that need to be overcome to allow the foot to make contact with the ground and prevent the model from sliding. However, if the simulation is used for contactless dynamics trajectory tracking, it works well. The AMBF simulation was used to test the various controllers to test the real-time control. The AMBF simulation platform has much potential for future application and testing of controllers and models. 

The open-source dynamics and controller server expands the functionality of AMBF by allowing the dynamics of the model to be calculated for use in custom controllers. The dynamics server parses the AMBF model files into the RBDL model. This pipeline ensures that the RBDL model matches the AMBF model, which is critical for model-based controllers. Additionally, using a ROS abstraction layer allows the developer to use any language to communicate with the server. This is important for community use and development since the community does not need to understand the kinematics and dynamics of their robot to build a controller. The controller server perfectly meshes with the dynamics server to build a concise pipeline to control robots in the AMBF. This package was released open-source for community development. Releasing open-source packages is crucial for proper research; it allows others to build and expand research without rebuilding and redeveloping everything previously accomplished.   


\section{iLQR and A-SMC Controllers}

The two controllers developed in this dissertation were the iLQR and the A-SMC cooperative controller. Both expanded on the current models and added new features. The iLQR controller incorporated non-linear models to overcome the limitation of linear models and incorporated the output parameters of GMM to calculate the path and co-variance values along the desired motion. This methodology allows all but the $R$ matrix to be calculated in a concise pipeline, from demonstration collection to generation of the torques. The $R$ matrix can be calculated using a gradient descent method. However, due to the nature of the iLQR controller, it is not suitable for real-time control since the torque has to be calculated offline. This can be overcome using an iLQR torque as a feed forward term and a PD controller for rejection of closed-loop disturbance. Additionally, it is well suited to be combined with the A-SMC for the standard interaction torque. 

The presented A-SMC controller expands on the literature by introducing a closed-loop human controller and an iLQR input as the standard interaction torque. The closed-loop human controller can simulate an FES-type controller, typical for hybrid lower limb exoskeletons. It shows that the A-SMC controller was able to adapt to the changing torque provided by the human. The A-SMC controller produced lower torque when the human controller provided sufficient torque and produced more when the human controller could not provide enough torque. The A-SMC was also able to adapt on the fly to torque change that could arise during fatigue. 

The tuning methodology presented to tune the A-SMC allows for the many parameters of the controller to be optimally tuned. This contribution is valuable since the A-SMC controller has a large number of parameters that are scaled with the dimensionality of the system. These parameters have complex coupling making it difficult to tune by hand and can lead to non-optimal parameter selection. The presented method is capable of tuning high parameter systems and be designed to optimize a cost function to ensure the parameters find a local minima.
