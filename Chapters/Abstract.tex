Robotic lower limb exoskeletons play a key role in the future of rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries and other physical impairments. The research field of lower limb exoskeletons is vast and made up of several distinct and connected fields. This dissertation examines fields and how they are connected and can be used to develop and test new robotic lower limb exoskeletons. Several new joint exoskeleton knee joint designs are presented and tested with a customizable and reconfigurable exoskeletons. A simulation platform is presented for the testing of both controllers and dynamics using a open source simulation package. Human motion data is collected, parsed, and encoded to build trajectory model for generalized trajectories. This is shown for both stair climbing and gait cycles reproduction. Two different controller architecture are also presented. The first is a new approach to using an iterative linear quadratic regulator with learning from demonstration. The second controller is a expand approach to assistive controller for shared control between a person and exoskeleton. Analysis is presented to tune the control and that the controller responses lower when the engagement from the  human increases.
