\section{Exoskeleton Simulations}
Simulation is a crucial aspect of exoskeleton development. It allows the development of multiple control algorithms for the exoskeleton without the difficulties associated with experimentally testing the exoskeleton on a person. Simulation allows the system to be modeled, controlled, and tested before the implementation in experimental environments. It can be a complicated method, but it is essential to develop the controllers \cite{ZLAJPAH2008879}.   

Sit to stand motion is one of the many movements modeled in simulation to model dynamics and test control algorithms. In \cite{reiner1998patient}, simulation is used to model a patient-driven approach in which the the upper-body effort is used to stimulate leg muscles through Functional Electrical Stimulus (FES) \cite{lynch2008functional} \cite{rushton1997functional}. Simulink/Matlab design a tracking algorithm to model the upper body of the human. The PID controller implemented in Matlab/Simulink \footnote{https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html} controlled the orientation of the human's torso. 

Yan \textit{et. al} combined the Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems \footnote{https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/adams} (ADAMS) and Matlab/Simulink to compare the trajectory of an exoskeleton controlled with a PID controller to their developed sliding mode control algorithm \cite{Yan_2017}. ADAMS is the simulation environment for the physical model, while MATLAB calculates the control algorithm. ADAMS was also used by Copilusi \textit{et. al} to perform dynamic analysis of a light-weight lower-extremity exoskeleton, where simulation results presented ample performance for walking rehabilitation  \cite{copilusi2014}. ADAMS also performed the numerical simulation \cite{geonea2017design} of the lower-extremity exoskeleton and compare the experimental walking of healthy subjects. 

While all these approaches have different objectives, they all successfully use simulation to model and develop controllers for their systems;   this shows the versatility and capability of using simulation for exoskeleton development.
