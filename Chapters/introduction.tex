\chapter{Introduction}

Exoskeletons are a branch of human-machine robotic systems. Many different types of exoskeletons provide different functionality levels and are designed to meet different requirements. Rehabilitative lower-limb exoskeletons enhance gait motion for people with reduced lower body control; this is an essential field of study for people with spinal cord injuries or other neurological injuries. Lower limb exoskeletons provide a method of enhancing and providing external support to the person. Increasing the research in this field will improve the lives of people. Unfortunately, exoskeleton research is proprietary, expensive, and requires a vast knowledge of engineering and biomechanics. This research aims at solving several problems currently in the field and provide open source tools for exoskeleton development and research. This work is divided between the development of the controller and open source tools. The controller will take advantage of learning from demonstration and provide assistive torques to the person wearing the exoskeleton.


This work focused on developing a simulation framework to control a robotic lower-limb exoskeleton. The aim and functionality of these exoskeletons are not for recreational use but for rehabilitation use. Therefore, the exoskeleton's controls will not be designed to handle arbitrary disturbances and collisions with the environment. It is assumed that the controllers are being used in a safe and open environment to avoid obstacles. The controller will focus on using human motion capture data to generate gait motions and control the exoskeleton joints. The contributions are separated into implementation and conceptual contributions. The implications contributions enabled the testing and development of the conceptual development and the conceptual developments. The contributions are summarized below and will be discussed throughout the remainder of the paper. 


\begin{enumerate}[wide, nosep, labelindent = 0pt, topsep = 1ex]
\item[\textbf{\textbf{Conceptual}}]
    \item  Modeling of an exoskeleton and human in simulation that couples the torque and integration. The exoskeleton will have sensors to measure the joint kinematics. The exoskeleton will measure the human torque to allow for cooperative controllers.  
    \item A trajectory controller based on human demonstration mocap data. A method using mocap data will be presented to train a generalized trajectory for an exoskeleton to follow a learned trajectory. 
    \item An optimal controller procedure using human demonstration for minimizing the control input. A method will be presented using optimal control theory and human motion to develop a controller. 
    \item Cooperative controller for shared control of a lower limb exoskeleton to handle the reduced torque of the person. The human torques will be generated using muscle models. The exoskeleton controller will account for the fatigue and reduction of torque. 
\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}[wide, nosep, labelindent = 0pt, topsep = 1ex]
\item[\textbf{\textbf{Implementation}}]
    \item Open source toolkit for analyzing and parsing mocap data with tools for gait analysis. This toolkit will contain tools for handle marker data and rigid bodies.  
    \item Open source hardware of the lower limb exoskeleton for passive data collection. The exoskeleton will have sensors for sensing the motion and be passive purely for data collection.
    \item A collection of joint data from a range of subjects, climbing stairs and walking, will be released open source for community use.  
    \item Implementation of an exoskeleton and human simulation for testing and implementation of the controller.
    \item A controller will be implemented that integrates the human and exoskeleton for a cooperative controller in simulation. The controller will measure the human torque generated by a muscle model while the exoskeleton provides the additional torque to follow a trajectory.
